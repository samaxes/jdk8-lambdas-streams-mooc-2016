> **Java SE 8 (JDK 8)** introduced a fundamentally new way of programming in Java with the introduction of Lambda expressions.
>
> Lambda provides a simple way to pass functionality as an argument to another method, such as what action should be taken when someone clicks a button, or how to sort a set of names. Lambda expressions enable you to do this, to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
>
> You may have heard about Lambda expressions, and are curious what impact it will have on you as a Java developer.
>
> This course is designed to answer your questions and more.
>
> Have you ever wondered what Lambda expressions are in Java?  
> Have you ever wanted to write parallel code in Java without worrying about threads and locking?  
> Have you ever wanted to process collections of data without using loops?  
> Have you ever wanted to do functional programming in Java?
>
> All of these questions will be answered in this practical hands-on **MOOC**. This course introduces two major new changes to the Java platform: Lambda expressions and the Stream API.  
> Each week there will be a number of exercises to test the knowledge of the students. These will take the form of a description of how some data needs to be processed and a test case for the desired result.  
> The student will write code using the Stream API and lambda expressions to solve the exercise.
